4. Example for input
   A) **From a Slack conversation (#feature-phoenix, yesterday):**
"DevTeam: @Alex, the new authentication module is showing high latency during peak load tests, specifically after 1000 concurrent users. Response times jumped from 50ms to 500ms. Check the DB queries, might be N+1."
"Alex: Copy that, investigating. Also, remember the decision to use OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow, not implicit. Legal confirmed it's essential for compliance."
"PMTeam: @Sarah, just saw the market research from Beta Group 3, users love the 'dark mode' option, but onboarding flow confused 30% of new sign-ups. Need to simplify step 2 and 3 significantly. Q4 target still Nov 15th for soft launch."

**From an email (Subject: "Phoenix Feature - Legal Review Notes"):**
"...further to our discussion, ensure all user data handling is compliant with GDPR Article 5(1)(a) ‚Äì lawful, fair, transparent processing. Implied consent is not sufficient for certain data types. Explicit opt-ins are required for marketing communications. Data retention policy is 7 years for financial records."

**From a PDF (snippet from "Project Phoenix Design Doc v2.1"):**
"...The 'Phoenix' feature introduces a personalized dashboard for user analytics. Key metrics include daily active users, feature adoption rates, and conversion funnels. The backend will utilize a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for flexible schema. Frontend is React-based. Initial user base target is 50,000 within 3 months post-launch."

**From a Meeting Transcript (snippet from 'Weekly Standup, 2025-07-29'):**
"Team decided to pivot on analytics visualization; the current charting library is too slow. @DevTeam, investigate D3.js or ECharts for performance. Also, QA reported critical bug #456 related to user profile updates failing silently. Needs high priority fix."

B) **From a Support Ticket (Ticket ID: 78901):**
"User complained about difficulty finding the 'export to CSV' button. Said it's 'buried deep in settings.' Suggested placing it next to the data table."

**From a Chat Transcript (Zendesk, 2025-08-01):**
"Customer: My custom reports always show #VALUE! for the 'Profit Margin' column. Calculation seems off."
"Agent: Can you confirm your input values for Revenue and Cost? Are there any blanks?"
"Customer: All filled. Maybe a rounding issue? Or does it not like negative values?"

**From a Sales Call Recording (Transcribed Snippet):**
"...and the client, ABC Corp, mentioned they'd sign the enterprise deal if we had direct integration with Salesforce CRM, specifically for automated lead syncing. They said it's a 'deal-breaker' for their current workflow. Also, they asked about our roadmap for mobile app features ‚Äì specifically offline access."

**From an NPS Survey Comment (Open Text):**
"Love the new UI! But the mobile app frequently crashes on my Android. Needs stability improvements. Also, still waiting for the dark mode that was promised last year!"

3) **From Research Paper A (Abstract):**
"Our study demonstrates that Factor X has a significant positive correlation with market volatility (p < 0.01). Data collected from 2010-2020 via satellite imagery."

**From Research Paper B (Conclusion):**
"Conversely, our meta-analysis of similar studies suggests Factor X exhibits a negligible correlation with market volatility (r = 0.05, ns). This discrepancy may be due to the inclusion of a broader dataset (2000-2022) and diverse data collection methodologies including ground-based sensors."

**From Internal Whitepaper (Section 3.2: Market Drivers):**
"Preliminary internal analysis, based on Q1-Q2 2025 sales data, indicates Factor X has a moderate inverse relationship with consumer spending in the tech sector, suggesting it acts as a leading indicator for downturns."

**From an Expert Interview Transcript (Snippet):**
"I'd say Factor X is highly dependent on global energy prices. When oil spikes, you see a direct, immediate impact on X, more so than any other variable."
